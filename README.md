# Hi, there 👋

I'm **Ornab “Oli” Olindo** — a Business Intelligence professional with **7+ years** building
**Power BI** dashboards, solid **SQL** data models, and end-to-end **ETL**. I also apply
**machine learning & predictive analytics** for forecasting, segmentation, and KPI tracking.
Based in **Toronto**, PGD in **Business Analytics (Humber)**.

My focus: turn messy, multi-source data into **clear, decision-ready insights**.

## 📊 BI Projects (Power BI / SQL)

### Restaurant Analytics (Toast POS)
A full Power BI report for a quick-service restaurant:
- **Sales by Day & Daypart** (breakfast/lunch/dinner), **payment mix**, and **discounts**.
- Star schema: `FactSales`, `DimDate`, `DimStore`, `DimMenuItem`, `DimTender`.
- **Power Query** for data cleanup, parameterized file imports, data quality checks.
- **DAX** for YTD/MoM, rolling 28-day averages, promo lift, and % of total measures.
- Shows where revenue comes from and when to staff or promote.

### Supply Chain OTIF (Dairy)
Operational analytics for distribution:
- **OTIF** trends, **lead time**, pick accuracy, and freshness SLA monitoring.
- Modeled facts/dimensions to separate order, shipment, and delivery events.
- DAX measures for on-time %, in-full %, and SLA breaches.
- Helps identify bottlenecks and improve service reliability.

### House Damage Claims (Insurance)
Severity segmentation & cost drivers:
- Loss amounts, claim counts, and **region/weather** relationships.
- Model with claim facts + date/location/policy dimensions.
- Feature flags for surge events; visuals to prioritize adjuster resources.

### SQL Data Analysis – Physical Data Model
- Clean **star/snowflake** patterns; example T-SQL for views and data validation.
- Focus on naming standards, SCD handling, and query performance fundamentals.

## 🧪 DS / ML Projects (Python / SAS)

### Time Series Sales Forecasting (LSTM & ARIMA)
- Comparative forecasting with baseline ARIMA vs. LSTM.
- Feature engineering for events, promos, holidays, and moving windows.
- Evaluated with RMSE/MAE; discussion on when classical vs. deep learning wins.

### Text Classification (Stack Overflow)
- End-to-end NLP pipeline: cleaning, TF-IDF/embeddings, linear vs. tree models.
- Error analysis to guide feature iteration and thresholding for precision/recall.

### SAS Clinical / Risk Modeling (PROC SQL/STAT)
- Reproducible pipelines for dataset assembly and feature engineering.
- Scorecards, model diagnostics, and lift/KS summaries.

## 🧰 Tech I use
- **Power BI:** DAX, Power Query, data modeling, role-level security, bookmarks
- **SQL:** T-SQL, views, stored procedures, performance basics
- **ETL / Reporting:** SSIS/SSRS, scheduled refresh, source control habits
- **Python:** pandas, scikit-learn, statsmodels, basic plotting
- **SAS:** Base/STAT, PROC SQL, modeling workflows
- **Cloud / Data:** Azure, Snowflake (fundamentals & connectors)

---

## How I work
- Start with the **business question**, design a **clean model**, then build **fast, readable visuals**.
- Prefer **documented** Power Query steps and **well-named** DAX measures.
- Keep a small **data-quality checklist**: types, nulls, duplicates, keys, and row counts.

---

## What I’m exploring next
- Better metric layers for semantic models  
- Lightweight MLOps for scheduled retraining and drift checks
